AES Encryption Implementation (Learning Project)
Tech stack: JavaScript (Vanilla)
Implemented AES encryption & decryption from scratch (no external crypto libraries)
Supported ECB & CBC modes
Handled Unicode input
Learned cryptographic fundamentals:
S-box, key expansion
Finite field operations
Block cipher structure
Project helped build strong understanding of security & low-level logic
